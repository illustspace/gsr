# Introduction

The GSR is a smart contract designed to take digital assets from any chain or
centralized storage system, and allow owners to record a location and configure
a scene for the asset.

## GSR Projects

The GeoSpatialRegistry itself is a smart contract, but there are a few ways to
access the placements contained inside it:

### SDK

### Indexer API

### Indexer Explorer

### Raw Smart Contract calls
